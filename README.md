# Maze-Problem
Recursive Binary-Maze Solving Algorithm

/*This program uses recursion and solves a binary maze and outputs the path it takes as well as 
 *whether or not the maze was solvable to being with. It reads the dimensions of a maze, 
 *the binary maze matrix and the starting and ending points from a text file.
