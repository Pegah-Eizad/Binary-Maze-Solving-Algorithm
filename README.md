# Maze-Problem
Recursive Binary-Maze Solving Algorithm

This program uses recursion and solves a binary maze given by a user-input text file (for formatting see the file input.txt) and outputs whether or not the maze is solvable and if it is, it outputs the path it took to solve the maze. 

The binary maze is made up of 0s and 1s. 0s indicate a path that can be passed through and the 1s represent walls. 
The program reads the dimensions of the maze, the binary maze matrix and the starting and ending points from the input text file.

How to use:

Run the driver program named Main.java. </br>
The program will ask you for the name of your input file.</br>
Type name then press enter.
